## Collaboration
For team_80 members, follow the following steps to collaborate:
1. Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website: https://github.com/zuri-training/Tcgen-team80

2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/zuri-training/Tcgen-team80.git"
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `git clone https://github.com/github_username/Tcgen-team80.git`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/Tcgen-team80.git`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. For frontend developers, prefix your branchname with `fn_`, and for backend developers, prefix your branchname with `bn_`. So that it looks like `fn_login_page` or `bn_login_page`. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.

## Deployment Instructions
Please not that the framework used is the Django Template Language
1. Clone the project repository to the server using `git clone https://github.com/zuri-training/Tcgen-team80.git main`
2. Create and activate a new virtual environment inside the project folder on the server using `python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>`
3. Install all project dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## How To Navigate Repository
1. `Tcgen-team80` is the django project folder.
